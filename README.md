Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss how to go about storing different objects like dictionaries with Parse. I read up on treating array fields of parse objects like sets and want to know more about other ways you can treat parse objects differently.
2. I would like to learn how to add things like followers and following.

## Notes

The biggest challenging was understanding how Parse works and how to access elements. Especially when I was trying to create a set, I needed to figure out what things I could and couldn't do with Parse.
